                <p>HOWARD ROARK laughed.</p>
                <p>
                    He stood naked at the edge of a cliff. The lake lay far below him. A frozen explosion of granite
                    burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. The water seemed immovable, the stone--
                    flowing. The stone had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust
                    and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion. The stone glowed, wet with
                    sunrays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. The rocks went on into the
                    depth, unchanged. They began and ended in the sky. So that the world seemed suspended in
                    space, an island floating on nothing, anchored to the feet of the man on the cliff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His body leaned back against the sky. It was a body of long straight lines and angles, each
                    curve broken into planes. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging at his sides, palms out. He felt
                    his shoulder blades drawn tight together, the curve of his neck, and the weight of the blood in
                    his hands. He felt the wind behind him, in the hollow of his spine. The wind waved his hair
                    against the sky. His hair was neither blond nor red, but the exact color of ripe orange rind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He laughed at the thing which had happened to him that morning and at the things which now
                    lay ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were questions to be faced and a plan
                    of action to be prepared. He knew that he should think about it. He knew also that he would
                    not think, because everything was clear to him already, because the plan had been set long
                    ago, and because he wanted to laugh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He tried to consider it. But he forgot. He was looking at the granite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He did not laugh as his eyes stopped in awareness of the earth around him. His face was like
                    a law of nature--a thing one could not question, alter or implore. It had high cheekbones
                    over gaunt, hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and steady; a contemptuous mouth, shut tight, the
                    mouth of an executioner or a saint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He looked at the granite. To be cut, he thought, and made into walls. He looked at a tree. To
                    be split and made into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust on the stone and thought of iron
                    ore under the ground. To be melted and to emerge as girders against the sky.
